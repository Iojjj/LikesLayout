# Likes Layout

LikesLayout is an implementation of layout that can draw likes similar to [Periscope app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tv.periscope.android).

## Setup and usage

To include this library to your project add dependency in **build.gradle** file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.iojjj:likeslayout:1.0.0'
}
```

There are three implementations of `LikesLayout` interface: **LikesFrameLayout**, **LikesLinearLayout**, **LikesRelativeLayout**. You can add them to your view via XML or in Java code.

```XML
<com.github.iojjj.likeslayout.LikesLinearLayout
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="250dp"
        app:likes_drawable="drawable resource id"
        app:likes_drawableWidth="custom drawable width"
        app:likes_drawableHeight="custom drawable height"
        app:likes_produceInterval="produce interval in milliseconds"
        app:likes_animationDuration="animationduration in milliseconds"
        app:likes_tintMode="off|on_successively|on_random"
        app:likes_tintColors="array resource id"
        app:likes_drawableAnimator="cannonical class name"
        app:likes_drawablePositionAnimator="cannonical class name"
        >
        
        <ImageButton
            ...
            app:likes_drawable="drawable resource id"
            app:likes_drawableWidth="custom drawable width"
            app:likes_drawableHeight="custom drawable height"
            app:likes_mode="enabled|disabled"
            app:likes_produceInterval="produce interval in milliseconds"
            app:likes_animationDuration="animationduration in milliseconds"
            app:likes_tintMode="off|on_successively|on_random"
            app:likes_tintColors="array resource id"
            app:likes_drawableAnimator="cannonical class name"
            app:likes_drawablePositionAnimator="cannonical class name"
            />
            
</com.github.iojjj.likeslayout.LikesLinearLayout>   
```

or

```JAVA
// create new LikesLayout
LikesLinearLayout likesLinearLayout = new LikesLinearLayout(getContext());
likesLinearLayout.setId(R.id.likes_layout);
// set layout height
final RelativeLayout.LayoutParams params = new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,
        (int) (getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density * 250));
likesLinearLayout.setLayoutParams(params);
likesLinearLayout.setOrientation(LinearLayout.HORIZONTAL);
// make sure your buttons located at the bottom of LikesLayout
likesLinearLayout.setGravity(Gravity.BOTTOM | Gravity.CENTER_HORIZONTAL);
likesLinearLayout.setPadding(0, 0, 0, (int) (getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density * 16));
// get attributes object that will store default values
likesLinearLayout.getAttributes().setAnimationDuration(1200);
likesLinearLayout.getAttributes().setTintMode(LikesAttributes.TINT_MODE_ON_SUCCESSIVELY);
likesLinearLayout.getAttributes().setTintColors(colors);

// it's time to add a button
ImageButton button = new ImageButton(getContext(), null, R.style.LikeButton_Grade);
button.setId(R.id.btn_grade);
button.setImageResource(R.drawable.ic_grade);
DrawableCompat.setTint(button.getDrawable(), ContextCompat.getColor(getContext(), R.color.colorAccent));
// you can create layout params for your button using LikesLayout.newLayoutParamsBuilder() method
// then using a builder you can set all necessary attributes values
final ViewGroup.LayoutParams params = likesLinearLayout
        .newLayoutParamsBuilder(ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT)
        .setDrawable(ContextCompat.getDrawable(getContext(), R.drawable.ic_grade_normal))
        .setAnimationDuration(3000)
        .setProduceInterval(500)
        .setPositionAnimatorFactory(new CustomPositionAnimatorFactory2())
        // don't forget to enable likes mode :)
        .setLikesMode(LikesAttributes.LIKES_MODE_ENABLED)
        .build();
// set parameters and add button to LikesLayout
button.setLayoutParams(params);
likesLinearLayout.addView(button);
```

There is the list of available attributes:

| Attribute name | ATLL | CBOBC | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| likes_animationDuration | yes | yes | Animation duration in milliseconds. | 1200 |
| likes_drawable | yes | yes | Drawable that will be drawn when user presses view. | null |
| likes_drawableAnimator | yes | yes | Drawable animator factory. | @string/likes_drawable_animator_factory |
| likes_drawableHeight | yes | yes | Custom drawable height. | 0 |
| likes_drawablePositionAnimator | yes | yes | Drawable's position animator factory. | @string/likes_position_animator_factory |
| likes_drawableWidth | yes | yes | Custom drawable width. | 0 |
| likes_mode | no | yes | Switch that allows to enable/disable drawing likes on touching child view. If `likes_drawable` is null, `likes_mode` will be considered as `disabled`. | disabled |
| likes_produceInterval | yes | yes | Rate at which new likes drawables are produced in milliseconds. | 300 |
| likes_tintMode | yes | yes | Switch that allows to enable/disable tinting drawables. | not_set |
| likes_tintColors | yes | yes | Array of colors used for tinting drawables. If array is empty, `likes_tintMode` will be considered as `off`.| null |

Where:

* **ATLL** - Available to LikesLayout
* **CBOBC** - Can be overridden by child?

## Produce likes programmatically
For this case you can use `LikesLayout.produceLikes(...)` methods, for example:

```JAVA
mLikesLayout.produceLikes(mBtnFavorite, 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

Make sure that child passed as an argument (`mBtnFavorite`) was added to this `mLikesLayout` (via XML or Java code). Otherwise you will get `IllegalArgumentException`.

## Custom Animations
You can provide your own animations. There are two types of animators available: `DrawableAnimator` and `PositionAnimator`. First one used for animating drawable itself (size, alpha, etc). Second one used for animating drawable's position. Note that `PositionAnimator` animates center of drawable. 
To use your custom animations you need to create `DrawableAnimator.Factory` or `PositionAnimator.Factory` implementations. Then you can set them via XML or in Java code.

## Restrictions 
* If you will not set `likes_mode` or set it to `disabled`, this view will not draw any likes.
* All attributes applicable to LikesLayout will be used as default values for child with `likes_mode` set to `enabled`.
* Custom drawable width and height will set exact size ignoring aspect ratio.
* Likes floating from bottom to top.
